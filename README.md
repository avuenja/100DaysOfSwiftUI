# 100 Days of SwiftUI

## Every day

- One hour per day (watching, reading or writing Swift)
- Tell people about your progress (twitter, instagram or anywhere platform)

### Day 1 - variables, simple data types, and string interpolation

- For to use variables in Swift, we using the `var` word, the variables are always mutable.
- Swift is a type-safe language, for `String` types we use double quotes (""), to involve a value. For values `Integer` we  pass directly the number or use `underscore` for separate the number.
- For being a type-safe language, we can't attribute a different type of value after to attribute the first time.
- Multi-lines string we owe to use three double quotes (""") in start and end of value. For format the multi-lines strings, we pass the backslash (\).
- Double values we separate the decimal places with dot (.), and the boolean values can be `true` or `false`.
- String interpolation we use backslash (\) followed by parentheses (), that involve a variable.
- For immutable variables we owe to use the `let` word. Thus we create a constants.
- Type annotations: Also, we can to make explicit the variables/constants types, passing the type after name using `name: Type` e.g.: `let isActive: Bool = true`.
